# Experiments

Store lightweight experiment metadata here. Each run should capture:

- `config.yaml` snapshot of training parameters.
- `metrics.json` with evaluation outputs.
- Optional plots (ROC, PR) saved in `artifacts/`.

Use `experiments/runs/` for automatically generated timestamped folders.
