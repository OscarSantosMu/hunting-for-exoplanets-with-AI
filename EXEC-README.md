# NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025

## Summary Project: Exoplanet Detection with AI/ML (Kepler, K2, TESS)

AI/ML-based platform that replicates and enhances NASA’s **ExoMiner** model through a multi-model ensemble combining deep learning (**ExoNet**/**AstroNet**) and classical algorithms (Random Forest, LightGBM). The system automatically analyzes open exoplanet datasets from Kepler, K2, and TESS to identify and classify new planetary candidates with high recall and interpretability.

Deployed on Microsoft Azure, the solution includes a web interface (GoDaddy domain) that is both accessible and inclusive: a professional view for researchers and an educational, interactive mode designed for children and non-technical audiences. Users can upload their own datasets, visualize model predictions, and explore an interactive glossary of variables and metrics.

Our project directly addresses NASA’s challenge of scaling exoplanet detection beyond manual analysis, making data exploration efficient, connected, and understandable for everyone. It is important because it accelerates scientific discovery, promotes STEM education, and demonstrates how inclusive AI can bring space science closer to society.

## Background and Previous Research

This project builds on high-impact research in the astronomical and machine learning communities:

- **ExoMiner (NASA, 2021):** a deep neural network that validated over 300 new exoplanets in Kepler data, introducing diagnostic branches and stratified cross-validation.
- **ExoNet / AstroNet (Google AI, 2018–2020):** convolutional models based on global and local views of light curves, pioneering the use of deep learning for planetary classification.
- **Robovetter (NASA Kepler Pipeline):** a rule-based system with physical indicators that mimicked the manual validation process of astronomers.
- **High-performance classical models (Random Forest, LightGBM, SVM):** recent research has shown that, with a well-designed set of transit and diagnostic variables, these algorithms achieve precision levels comparable to neural networks with lower computational cost.

This work takes these approaches as a foundation, reproduces them under a reproducible framework, and combines them in a scientific ensemble aiming to achieve state-of-the-art results with greater efficiency and accessibility.

## Value Proposition

**Problem:**  
Exoplanet detection still relies on manual review and extensive analysis of millions of light curves, creating bottlenecks, human bias, and loss of scientific opportunities.

**Solution:**  
A hybrid AI/ML model deployed on lightweight and efficient infrastructure that:

- Automates exoplanet detection in NASA open data.
- Allows uploading custom datasets for validation or experimentation.
- Visually explains its decisions, bringing the scientific process closer to people without technical backgrounds.

The project combines scientific rigor, computational efficiency, and inclusive design, enabling both professional use by researchers and understanding by students or children.

## Technical Architecture and Scientific Pipeline

The system is deployed on **Microsoft Azure**, on a dedicated Virtual Machine that integrates all components of the workflow:

### 1. Azure Infrastructure

- **Web server (GoDaddy):** hosts the web application accessible from a custom domain.
- **Backend/REST API:** orchestrates requests between the interface, database, and models.
- **Internal database:** stores user-uploaded datasets, predictions, and metrics generated by the system.
- **AI/ML pipeline:** model training, evaluation, and deployment, executed in a contained manner within the VM.

### 2. Logical System Architecture

- **Data Layer:** includes KOI (Kepler), K2, and TOI (TESS) catalogs, along with user-uploaded data.
- **Processing Layer:** applies detrending (Savitzky–Golay), noise corrections, normalization, and generation of global/local views of light curves.
- **Modeling Layer:** hosts DL models (ExoMiner, ExoNet) and classical models (RF, LightGBM, SVM) trained with stratified cross-validation.
- **Ensemble Layer:** combines results using calibrated stacking/blending, optimizing AUC-PR and recall.
- **Results and Interface Layer:** presents findings through interactive graphs, comparative metrics, and visual explanations (feature importances, PR/ROC curves).

### 3. Scientific Pipeline

1. Ingestion and validation of multi-mission data.
2. Preprocessing with reproducible methods per mission (Kepler, K2, TESS).
3. Model training, evaluation, and selection.
4. Final ensemble and threshold calibration.
5. Web deployment and visualization of results.

This architecture is lightweight, efficient, and resilient, capable of running without heavy infrastructure or dependencies outside Azure.

## Web Interface and Accessibility

The interface was designed to be accessible, intuitive, and ergonomic, focused on user experience and understanding without technical jargon.

### Specialized View (Researchers)

- Allows uploading custom datasets, training models, running predictions, and visualizing advanced metrics (AUC, PR, F1).
- Includes an interactive glossary of 50–100 variables describing each physical parameter of NASA missions.

### Child-Friendly View (Educational)

- Introduces the world of exoplanets with simple language and visual materials: videos, animations, and interactive examples.
- The goal is to inspire scientific curiosity in children and non-technical communities, using playful design and accessible colors.

The application prioritizes inclusion, with an educational approach that embraces cultural, gender, and ability diversity. The entire system can be understood without technical knowledge, meeting universal accessibility principles.

## Impact and Relevance

- **For NASA and the scientific community:** reduces analysis time and prioritizes planetary candidates with greater precision.
- **For society and education:** transforms AI into a comprehensible and motivating tool, fostering STEM vocations from early stages.
- **For sustainable development:** contributes to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs 4 and 9) by promoting quality education and responsible innovation.
- **For equity:** designs an open, accessible, and inclusive scientific space where anyone can learn or contribute to the search for new worlds.

## Future Vision

The project aims to evolve into an open platform connected to future NASA missions (JWST, PLATO, Roman), incorporating new APIs and spectroscopic data.

In education, the development of interactive and gamified modules for inclusive astronomical learning is planned.

In the long term, the system could scale to a citizen science network, where any user—scientist or not—can analyze real data and actively participate in exoplanet discovery.
