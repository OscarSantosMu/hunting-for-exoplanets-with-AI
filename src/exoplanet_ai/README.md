We decided to keep the Realtime and Batch APIs separately in these repositories:

1. FastAPI (/predict-realtime, /predict-batch)
    - [Repo](https://github.com/4-carrillo/serve_lightgbm_model_exo_azure)
2. Upload to Azure Blob Storage (required for /predict-batch)
    - [Repo](https://github.com/4-carrillo/upload_to_blob)
