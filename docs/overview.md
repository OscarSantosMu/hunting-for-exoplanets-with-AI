# Project Overview

This document captures the high-level goals for the Exoplanet AI project participating in the 2025 NASA Space Apps Challenge.

- **Problem**: Automate detection of exoplanet candidates from space mission datasets (Kepler, K2, TESS).
- **Approach**: Combine curated preprocessing pipelines, classical ML baselines, and interactive tooling (API + UI).
- **Deliverables**: Reproducible codebase, experiment tracking, documentation, lightweight deployment surface.
